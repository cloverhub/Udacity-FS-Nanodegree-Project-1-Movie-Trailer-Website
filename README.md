This is project 1 for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. It uses Python to generate a movie trailer website for my daughter's favorite dinosaur movies.

- entertainment_center.py: this file contains a list of dinosaur movie data for use in the media.py class
- fresh_tomatoes.py which creates a formatted html page to display dinosaur movie names, box art, and trailers

1. Download media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py into a local folder
2. Using Python IDLE, open entertainment_center.py
